I am Leyan Pan, a third-year Ph.D. student at the Georgia Institute of Technology advised by Prof. Wenke Lee. My research interests lie mainly in the theory and application of Machine Learning and Large Language Models in different fields, especially Computer Security. My current research interest is mainly focused on understanding the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models and applying such capabilities in security-related applications such as program analysis.

Before starting my Ph.D., I conducted research with Professor. Santosh Vempala regarding the emergence of Neural Collapse in the terminal phase of training in a deep neural network as part of my Master's Degree. My previous research project includes a survey of homomorphic encryption schemes and their application to computationally limited hardware under the guidance of Professor. Vincent Mooney.

I also have several industry-related experiences in Computer Security. In 2021, I worked at Facebook as a Silicon Security Engineering Intern. I developed a permission verification system for on-chip firewalls and wrote various security tests for confidential hardware. In 2020,  I worked at IBM security X-force Command Center as a Cyber Security Intern.  I used Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) to design a demonstrative water circulation system and used Python Programs to send attack payloads that would overfill the water tank or disable the system. I did my final presentation to approximately 100 IBM Security employees and received excellent feedback from many colleagues, my manager, and my mentor.

In my spare time, I like to explore and find great food as well as play video games.
